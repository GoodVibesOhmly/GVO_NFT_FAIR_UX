##IDEAS

#CODE

NFT projects will shift towards DTC marketplaces like @larvalabs. 
Managing user experience is critical for retention, and eliminating 3rd parties doesn’t hurt.
The decentralization of code bases makes it possible.

#UX

NFTs will unlock access to services and communities. (Q&As and tutorials with photographers). Social feeds based on NFT collections will emerge, providing insight into the strategy of top collectors, and a platform for collectors to interact. These feeds will evolve into social commerce marketplaces, featuring reviews, analytics, and more. As brands and creators seek to reinforce loyalty, community behavior will be rewarded with NFTs. Brands and creators will exchange NFTs for insights on product development: pain points, marketing claims, roadmap and more. The NFTs will unlock early access to product releases and potential profit sharing. Brands will track and maintain these key relationships. Upon demonstrating exceptional knowledge of a brand’s product, users can receive NFTs in exchange for onboarding newbies into the community, or providing support. This can be exponentially more impactful than a brand employee doing the same. NFT communities will gamify by highlighting the performance and participation of top holders. Top contributors will receive rewards and clout, thereby incentivizing communities to hold and participate in order to secure better returns on their investments.

#DEFI

Collateralization? To date, lenders have been averse to NFT holders borrowing against their assets. But as institutional $$$ flows in, and assets become better stores of value, collateral markets will promise flexibility and liquidity for all NFT holders, not just whales. Fractionalization? Splitting up NFTs into individual shares gives more people exposure to blue-chip assets, like owning a piece of a cryptopunk. The result? More liquidity for holders, and more appreciation of blue chip assets as money enters the markets. As enthusiasts become more comfortable staking and farming their holdings for yield, NFTs promise incentive beyond APY%. NFTs will become base DeFi assets, with community access included. These won't be simple savings plays—they'll also be investments in communities.
